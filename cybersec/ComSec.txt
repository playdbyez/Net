//RFC3552_summary
//RFC Security Guidelines (2003)

security can be divided into 2 parts:
Communication Security [COMSEC]
Systems Security [SYSSEC]



//COMSEC

>Confidentiality
(privacy when using data)

>Data Integrity 
(data sent matches the data recieved)

>Peer Entity Authentication
(the recipient of data is the one intended)

//FORMS 0f ATTACK

I    - Evesdropping
II   - Replay
III  - Deletion
IV   - Message Insertion
V    - Modification
VI   - Man-in-the-middle
VII  - Denial of Service


//DENIAL 0F SERVCE
These are attacks designed to consume machine resources or crash systems.
Easy to mount but difficult to stop.

//BLIND DoS ATTACKS
A dos not designed to retrieve any information

//FORGED TCP RST ATTACKS
Implemented to affect the TCP secion of a network...

//REPLAY ATTACKS
The attacker records a sequence of messages off of the wire and plays them back to the party which originally received them.


//BLIND ATTACKS
Sending forged packets but not receiving the responses.

//OFFINE CRYPTOGRAPHIC ATTTACKS
These refer to recovering data processed by the victim's secret key and then mounting a cryptanalytic attack on that key.


//PASSIVE ATTACKS
These are for attackers with limited control and with only read priviledges of a network


//ACTIVE ATTACKS
These are for attackers with write priviledges within the network


//DOWNGRADE ATTACK
Tampering with the negotiation of security mechanisms in order to force the partaking parties to negotiate weaker protection

//CHALLENGE RESPONSE
First the host and the user share some secret (shared keys or a password)
This can be done by a trusted third party such as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) like KERBEROS.
Then in order to authenticate the user, the host presents the user with a challenge.
Both the secret and the challenge are then retrieved by the host for verification 

//ONE TIME PASSWORD
Greater security than USERNAME/PASSWORD.
SecureID and DES Gold are variants of this scheme.
The user is provided with a list of passwords, which must be used once and in sequence 

//IPsec
In the case of IPv6 being used both IP Authentication Header and IP Encapsulation Security are mandatory.
Refer to : Bellovin, S., "Guidelines for Mandating the Use of IPsec",Work in Progress.


//SSL & TLS
Provide channel security for a TCP connection at layer 6 (Application)
and they both run over TCP however TLS is susceptible to IP layer attacks that IPsec is not.

//Authentication & Authorization
Authentication refers to identifying the user
Authorization refers to weather the authentic user can perform an action
Authorization necessarily relies on authentication!


Access Control List [ACL] is common mechanism of authorization that lists authorized users

Mail Security
S/MIME and PGP/MIME are both message oriented security protocols

[Section 6] 
The rest of RFC 3552 document proceeds to administer SMTP solutions for protectiong against,
replay attacks
dns spoofing
packet corruption
forged rts packets
forged ARP packets
spool files

HMAC
S/MIME
