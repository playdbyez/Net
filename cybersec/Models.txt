##### General Threat Info #####
Regardless of how specific the target of the attack,there are only three ways that a system can be threatned by:

1. Acquiring Data     = re-sale & action anticipation.
2. Misuse Credentials = discrete alterations & monitoring. 
3. Hijacking          = unauthorized re-routing & denial of access.


##### Attacker Capabilities #####
Attacker's capabilities for identifying possible vulnerabilities

1. Ammount of information 
2. Computing power
3. Control of the System

Automted atks   = less cost & less profit.
Targeted atks   = higher costs.


##### Vulnerability Exploitation Principles #####
Vulnerability   = weakness in a system.
Threat          = taking advantage of said weakness.

- Seven Principles of Social Engineering -
1.Authority
2.Intimidation
3.Consensus
4.Scarcity
5.Familiarity
6.Trust
7.Urgency

- Air Force's five Ds plus one principles -
1.Destroy
2.Deny
3.Degrade
4.Disrupt
5.Decieve
+.Defence


###### Threat Models #####
Part of the System's Development Lifecycle (SDL), these seek to anticipate an attacker's exploitation methods by taking its point of view
[] What part the system is it ?
[] What can go wrong with it ?
[] What can be done to prevent it ?
[] Are these security measures enough ?

.CIA Triad
Security model defining the core elements of a system's functionality. 
1. Confidentiality   = maintaining privacy through encryption, access control and legal protections
2. Integrity         = maintaining confidence in a system's behaviour through accuracy of output
3. Availability      = maintaining the system's permissions of access secure as appointed by its confidentility measures
+. Resiliance        = system's survivability to inevitable threats and how fast it can recuperate from attacks


.DREAD [2002]
(Risk = DREAD)
Risk-assesment model used by microsoft that emphasizes security through obscurity.
1. Damage           = how bad would an attack be?
2. Reproducibility  = how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
3. Exploitability   = how much work is it to launch the attack?
4. Affected users   = how many people will be impacted?
5. Discoverability  = how easy is it to discover the threat?

.STRIDE [2009]
Attack methodologies model for accessing possible ways of breaching a system.
1. Spoofing                   = Authenticity of the attacker's traces
2. Tampering                  = Integrity alterations that may go unnoticed
3. Repudiation                = Attributing guilt to the attacker's traces through valid evidence
4. Information disclosure     = Confidentiality of a system's data is breached from an unauthorized source
5. Denial of service          = Availability to existing resources may be exhausted
6. Elevation of privilege     = Authorization violations towards a system's access hierarchy

.PASTA [2015]
(Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
Risk-centric model from the attacker's perspective curated towards large organizations 
1. Objectives
2. Technology Enumeration
3. Application Decomposition
4. Threat Intelligence Consumption 
5. Vulnerability Analysis
6. Attack Simulation
7. Residual Risk Analysis


.Trike [2008]
( TRIKE = Requirements model + Implementation model)
Open source project comprised of two metholodogies combined into one
