##### General Threat Info #####
Regardless of how specific the target of the attack,there are only three ways that a system can be threatned by:

1. Acquiring Data     = re-sale & action anticipation.
2. Misuse Credentials = discrete alterations & monitoring. 
3. Hijacking          = unauthorized re-routing & denial of access.


##### Attacker Capabilities #####
Attacker's capabilities for identifying possible vulnerabilities

1. Ammount of information 
2. Computing power
3. Control of the System

Automted atks   = less cost & less profit.
Targeted atks   = higher costs.


##### Vulnerability Exploitation Principles #####
Vulnerability   = weakness in a system.
Threat          = taking advantage of said weakness.
1.Authority
2.Intimidation
3.Consensus
4.Scarcity
5.Familiarity
6.Trust
7.Urgency


###### Threat Models #####
Part of the System's Development Life Cycle, these seek to anticipate an attacker's exploitation methods by taking its point of view
[] What part the system is it ?
[] What can go wrong with it ?
[] What can be done to prevent it ?
[] Are these security measures enough ?



.CIA Triad
Security model defining the core elements of a system's functionality. 
1. Confidentiality   = maintaining privacy through encryption, access control and legal protections
2. Integrity         = maintaining confidence in a system's behaviour through accuracy of output
3. Availability      = maintaining the system's permissions of access secure as appointed by its confidentility measures
+. Resiliance        = system's survivability to inevitable threats and how fast it can recuperate from attacks


.DREAD
(Risk = DREAD)
Risk-assesment model used by microsoft that emphasizes security through obscurity.
1. Damage           = how bad would an attack be?
2. Reproducibility  = how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
3. Exploitability   = how much work is it to launch the attack?
4. Affected users   = how many people will be impacted?
5. Discoverability  = how easy is it to discover the threat?

.STRIDE
Attack methodologies model for accessing possible ways of breaching a system.
1. Spoofing                   = Authenticity of the attacker's traces
2. Tampering                  = Integrity alterations that may go unnoticed
3. Repudiation                = Attributing guilt to the attacker's traces through valid evidence
4. Information disclosure     = Confidentiality of a system's data is breached from an unauthorized source
5. Denial of service          = Availability to existing resources may be exhausted
6. Elevation of privilege     = Authorization violations towards a system's access hierarchy
