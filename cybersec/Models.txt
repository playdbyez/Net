##### General Threat Info #####
Regardless of how specific the target of the attack,there are only three ways that a system can be threatned by:

1. Acquiring Data     = used for re-sale & action anticipation.
2. Misuse Credentials = used for discrete alterations & monitoring. 
3. Hijacking          = used for unauthorized re-routing & denial of access.


##### Attacker Capabilities #####
Attacker's capabilities for identifying possible vulnerabilities

1. Ammount of information 
2. Computing power
3. Control of the System

After identifying weaknesses the attacker can chose to deploy from either two methods of attacks:
Automted atks   = less cost & less profit.
Targeted atks   = higher costs.


##### Vulnerability Exploitation Principles #####
Vulnerability   = a weakness in a system.
Threat          = an actor taking advantage of said weakness.

1.Authority
2.Intimidation
3.Consensus
4.Scarcity
5.Familiarity
6.Trust
7.Urgency


###### Threat Models #####
These seek to anticipate an attacker's exploitation methods by answering the following:
[] What part the system ?
[] What can go wrong with it ?
[] What can be done to prevent it ?
[] Is it enough ?



.CIA Triad
Basic security model defined for accessing risk
1. Confidentiality   = maintaining privacy through encryption, access control and legal protections.
2. Integrity         = maintaining confidence in a system's behaviour through accuracy of output. 
3. Availability      = maintaining the system's permissions of access secure as appointed by its confidentility measures.
+. Resiliance        = system's survivability to inevitable threats and how fast it can recuperate from attacks.



.STRIDE
General checklist for accessing possible methods of breaching a system
1. Spoofing                   = Authenticity of the attacker's traces
2. Tampering                  = Integrity alterations that may go unnoticed
3. Repudiation                = Attributing guilt to the attacker's traces through valid evidence
4. Information disclosure     = Confidentiality of a system's data is breached from an unauthorized source
5. Denial of service          = Availability to existing resources may be exhausted
6. Elevation of privilege     = Authorization violations towards a system's access hierarchy
