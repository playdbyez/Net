##### General Threat Info #####
Regardless of how specific the target of the attack,there are only three ways that a system can be threatned by:

1. Acquiring Data     = used for re-sale & action anticipation.
2. Misuse Credentials = used for discrete alterations & monitoring. 
3. Hijacking          = used for unauthorized re-routing & denial of access.
Automted atks   = less cost & less profit.
Targeted atks   = higher costs.



##### Vulnerability Exploitation Principles #####
Vulnerability   = a weakness in a system.
Threat          = an actor taking advantage of said weakness.

1.Authority
2.Intimidation
3.Consensus
4.Scarcity
5.Familiarity
6.Trust
7.Urgency



###### Security Model #####
>> CIA Triad + Resilience
1. Confidentiality   = maintaining privacy through encryption, access control and legal protections.
2. Integrity         = maintaining confidence in a system's behaviour through accuracy of output. 
3. Availability      = maintaining the system's permissions of access secure as appointed by its confidentility measures.
+. Resiliance        = system's survivability to inevitable threats and how fast it can recuperate from attacks.
