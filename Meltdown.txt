-Meltdown and Spectre atake-

relies on 'speculative execution' from the kernel/CPU (Memory)

Speculative Execution:
      Used only by Intel and Arm chips (not AMD)
      Since the max execution time is 4.0 Ghz
      in this type of execution the processor guesses the out of a command
      and runs it in the background
      Restrictions are not enforcewhen this type of procesing is being executed

CPU cache:
    Memory type of the CPU 
    It reads and writes to RAM
    CPU uses a cache system when retrieving info from RAM (copies small initiations)

Memory:
    RAM speed < CPU cache speed



  ::MELTDOWN::
Allows exploit to read protected memory off the CPU cache. (wifi pass)

When exchanging Data a website//application will write data to RAM
A cache (copy) of RAM is kept in the CPU...<continue>



    ::SPECTER::
Allows exploit to read memory from other apps running on the system (chrome info)


STAGE 1
A speculative.exe is forced, causing a gap between loading the info into the cache, and if the info requested has any security restriction.

STAGE 2
If the CPU is interrupted during this gap (transient instruction)
the info gets left loaded into the cache with no restriction.

STAGE 3
To recover the info from cache withouth triggering any direct memory operation, side-channel atakes are used

TASK:COMPLETE
recover sensitive information stored in the kernel, using
nothing more than an unprivileged application!
