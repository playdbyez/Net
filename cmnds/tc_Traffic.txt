Processing of traffic is controled by 3 kinds of objects:
[] Queueing Disciplines
[] Classes 
[] Filters


//
It is essential to set up a queue discipline that aims to be dequeued
As pre-configured by its filter and encryption only when and
If the network specified  in the pre-configuration is the one in reach.


Traffic Control's functionality:
limiting the bandwidth 
prioritising one network against another
over the encryption specified
