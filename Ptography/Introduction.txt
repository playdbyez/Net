Cryptography 2010

//Kerckhuff's Principle [ 1883 ]
"A crypto system should be secure even if an attacker knows of the details about the system,
with the exception of the secret key"
This passage remarks that a sharing keys requires lots of nuance and creative methods.
There is no mathematical proof that any cryptographic algorithm is 100% secure.
Only the duration of how many years a given crypto-algorithm has remained unbroken can be ascertained.
Algorithms should be released public but not the key.

Although Security is a bigger concept that encompasses cryptology,
Security cannot be achieved only by cryptology 
but with standardized algorithms, cipher-text, encrypt/decrypt keys
