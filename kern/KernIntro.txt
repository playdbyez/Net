######### Dev Communications ###########

Developer community's preferred methods of communicating updates from a project include:
>> Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
>> UseNet
>> Mailing List


#########:: Kernel ::#########

[] Usually distributed from repositories as a compressed tape file (tar.bz) plus a patch notes file

[] The most popular kernel is referred to as the stock kernel


##:: Patching ::##

[] Due to the bandwith limitations re-downloading a source file,
    developers prefer to include updates to the kernel via smaller upgrading files called patches

[] A patch file holds information on the differences between releases prior and post patch

[] Linux patches are made by a GNU tool called 'diff' that generates an unified diff file
