######### Dev Communications ###########

Developer community's preferred methods of communicating updates from a project include:
>> Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
>> UseNet
>> Mailing List


#########:: Kernel ::#########

[] Usually distributed from repositories as a compressed tape file (tar.bz) plus a patch notes file

[] The most popular kernel is referred to as the stock kernel


##:: Patching ::##

[] A patch file compares information on the differences between and file and its updated version
[] A patch file can be distributed in plain text or compressed (.gz / .bz2)
[] Due to the bandwith limitations of re-downloading a source file, developers prefer to include updates to the kernel via smaller upgrading files called patches
[] Linux patches are made by a GNU tool called 'diff' that generates an unified diff file, the patch is then applied with the 'patch' command


>> file.diff
[] Any diff file should be generated above the kernel root
[] Consits of a header section containing information on the two files which diff is comparing
[] Patch alterations are divided into blocks which are applied separately
[] If a block fails to be applied, the block section is then saved to file.c.rej
[] If a block fails to be applied, the original section which was not altered is saved to file.c.orig

##### Patching a plain file #####
$ diff -up linux-2.4.22-clean/mm/function.c linux-2.4.22-new/mm/function.c  > example.patch
$ cd linux-2.4.22-clean/
$ patch -p1  < ../example.patch


##### Patching a compressed file #####
$ cd linux-2.4.22-clean/
$ gzip -dc ..example.patch.gz | patch -p1
