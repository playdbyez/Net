[] Basic Symmetric Cipher []

Cipher is a means of turning plaintext into ciphertext under the control of a key.
Within a symmetric scheme the key must be known by both communicating parties only.
 
.Encryption
m = plainText
e = function
k = key
c = cipherText
 
c = e^k(m)
 
 
.Decryption
c = cipherText
e = function
k = key
m = plainText
 
m = d^k(c)
