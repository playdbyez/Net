[] Basic Symmetric Cipher []

Cipher is a means of turning plaintext into ciphertext under the control of a key.
Within a symmetric scheme the key must be known by both communicating parties only.

Security of the cipher depends on how hard it is to perfrom an exhaustive key search against it.
Symmetric schemes usually try to hide the underlying statistics of the language used within them.
Since it is possible to turn one plaintext into two ciphers or more, the ammount of ciphers present must be bigger or equal to the mount of plaintext characters.
Because it is possible to have used a different key per character, the key length mut be bigger or equal to the ammount of ciphers

.Encryption
m = plainText
e = function
k = key
c = cipherText
 
c = e^k(m)
 
 
.Decryption
c = cipherText
e = function
k = key
m = plainText
 
m = d^k(c)
