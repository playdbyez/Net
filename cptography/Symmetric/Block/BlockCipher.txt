.Encryption
Cryptographic block = block cipher + mode of operation

MODES OF OPERATION
- ECB = Electronic Code Block Mode
- CBC = Cipher Block Chaining Mode [recommended]
- OFB = Output Feed Back Mode
- CFB = Cipher Feed Back Mode
- CTR = Counter Mode               [recommended]
- GCTR = Galois Counter Mode       [recommended]


[] Operates on plain text one block at a time through a key block to produce equivalent blocks of cipher text.
[] Symmetric encryption
[] Modern Block ciphers are built on permutations and substitutions
[] Fast block is symmetric
[] These should act like a family of PRPs indexed by the key space 
[] The key block must be of equal size to plaintext 
[] Its goal is being a secure pseudo-random permutation
[] Block encryption is usually tested against the Linux Penguin visual example.
[] Faster on Software than stream ciphers
[] Stateless and Bijective thus, uses permutations
[] Block sizes = 64 to .. bits
[] Due to size constrictions of the block function, it is necessary to organize its encryption scheme
  and said schemes are created out of the block cipher model via different modes of operation.
[] Block ciphers can also be turned into a stream cipher, given the right combination with a mode of operation.
[] Modes and cipher blocks can be designed independently
[] A mode should be implemented upon a secure pseudo-random permutation block cipher dictated by the PRP security game
[] Depending on the mode, if the cipher text is altered in a given block 
  during transmission, then said alteration may render the block un-decryptable.
  Initialization Vectors (IVs) may be necessary depending on the mode employed.
[] An Initialization Vector ensures that the first cipher block is different even if the message is identical.
  This is accomplished by IVs through it being a random cipher used for encryption against the first block to be encrypted.

### [ECB] ###
.Encryption
c1 = eₖ (m1)
c2 = eₖ (m2)
c2 = eₖ (m3)
 
> Can decrypt single blocks regardless of its order.
 
> Multi-threading operations are supported.
 
> Encryption & decryption are very fast.
 
> ECB however, suffers from not being random enough to be deemed secure.
  This means that cipher blocks will be exactly equal for identical message blocks.
 
### [CBC] ###
 
> Encryption & decryption are slow.
 
> Does not support parallelization.
 
> Employs the use of Initialization Vector to compliment the encryption scheme
 
> CBC however, suffer from error propagation  which is limited from the cipher 
  block altered to the cipher block directly after it.
 
 
### [CTR] ###
 
> Requires a shared nonce value to compliment the shared key and
  said nonce increases per block while being public.
 
> Parallelization is supported thanks to the ordering provided by the nonce value.
 
> Due to encryption being on the counter to produce an output stream,
  this mode is classed as a stream cipher also.
 
> Crib draggin attacks

[] The above DES implementations obtain security through being Iterated Block Ciphers that me use of a simple 'round function' where the number of rounds can be varied or fixed.
[] Each round consists of substitution, permutation and key addition.
[] The more rounds implemented the more security is obtained.
