[] Transposition Cipher []
Also known as a simple permutation cipher
Aims at encrypting message m by 
creating an array S[] of n characters
where n =< m lenght
array S[] consists of increasing values 0 ... n-1
A permutation is then applied to array S[] 
finnaly making S[] hold the value of the key
Message m is padded if its lenght is not a factor of the lenght of the key
priv.key

ENCRYPTION
m = "once upon a time"
n = 5
S[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
**permutation on S[]**
S[] = {1, 3, 0, 2, 4}
key = S[]

** since m's lenght (13) is not a factor of n (5)**
**padding on m**
m = "once upon a timehl"

**m is mapped to groups of size n (5)**
**key dictates the repositioning of characters**
**key is repeated along the length of m**
m  = "o n c e u   p o n a t   i m e h l"
k  =  1 3 0 2 4   1 3 0 2 4   1 3 0 2 4

**m is remapped to cipher**
k  =  01234 01234 01234
c  =  coenu npaot eihml

>> This cipher is particularly weak to Chosen Plaintext Attacks
