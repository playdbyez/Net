> Cipher is a means of turning plaintext into ciphertext under the control of a key.  

> Within a symmetric scheme the key must be known by both communicating parties only. 

> The simplest and hence fastest computational operation is âŠ•.

> Within symmetric ciphers we consider its size in bits.  

> Security of the cipher depends on how hard it is to perfrom an exhaustive key search against it.  

> Symmetric schemes usually try to hide the underlying statistics of the language used within them.  

> Since it is possible to turn one plaintext into two ciphers or more, the ammount of ciphers present must be bigger or  equal to the mount of plaintext characters,  
  and because it is possible to have used a different key per character, the key length must be bigger or equal to the ammount of cipher characters.  

> A typical approach is to first us a public key scheme to determine session keys/ message keys
  then encrypt communication via either a stream or block cipher.

> A bulk cipher is a speed oriented cipher of the symmetric variety, namely stream ciphers and block ciphers.
> Bulk ciphers are broken either through:
   - Passive Attack
           >> Aimed at either recoverin the key or decrypting parts of the message
           >> Only allowed to listen to encrypted transmissions (traffic analysis)
           >> Easier to mount

   - Active Attack
           >> Allowed to insert and deleteme messages or replay them (insertion attack)
           >> Easily detectable






 ############::Chosen Plaintext Attack::##############  
Consists of the attacker obtaining a cipher equivalent
of his own message directly from the admin.



############::Insertion Attack::##############  




############::Implementation Attacks ::##############  
A Side channel attack would consist of employing an osciloscope against a microprocessor's pins
and recording the ondulation  or observe  the timing behaviour in hope to decode the key being used within the chip.  

  
############::KeySearch::##############   
cipher key size = 64bits  
solution = 2^64 bits  
roughly = 2^88  
  
If the key manages a lookup table, we compare its character to  
its possibility of being said character from the alphabet (26 letters) granting us a 26! factorial.  
cipher[0] = 1 out of 26 letters of the alphabet  
cipher[1] = 1 out of 25 letters of the alphabet  
cipher[2] = 1 out of 24 letters of the alphabet ...
