[] Substitution Cipher []
Operates on latters and its aimed at replacing every letter by a fixed ciphertext letter,
Thus it functions by mapping the alphabet text to a random permutation of characters.

 CRYPTOGRAPHY

### Mono-alphabetic version
only one alphabet is used as a cipher and thus each plain text
corresponds to the same cipher character throughout the message.
key space is the cipher's range of characters
 
plainText
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
G	O	Y	D	S	I	P	E	L	U	A	V  C	R	J	W	X	Z	N	H	B	Q	F	T	M	K
cipherKey
 
 
plainText Message = Hello 
cipherText Message = ESVVJ
key space = 26! 
          = 2⁸⁸




### Polyalphabetic version
a number of alphabets were used for encryption in order to avoid repeated ciphers.
renders naive frequency analysis inaffective against it.


plainText

cipher 1
cipher 2


message[i] 
if i == odd then msg[i] = cipher1
if i == even then msg[i] = cipher2

plainText Message  = HELLO
cipherText Message = SHLJV

key space = (!26)² 
          =  162644002617632464507038883409628607021056000000000000 ≈ 2^176.76391  ≈ 2 ¹⁷⁷
