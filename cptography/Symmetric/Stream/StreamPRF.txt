## [LFSR] ##

> A key produced by a keystream generator is only secure if:
  - it has large linear complexity
  - it has pseudo-random properties proven by passing a number of statistical random number tests.
  - it has a large value for the period of its sequence.

The period of the sequenced is computed because the keystream is made from a finite deterministic process such as the key length.
Once the combination repeats, there will exist an initial number N known as the period, where:
K[i] = K[i+N]
The smallest N that satisfies the above must be the period of the sequence.

A sequence is deemed periodic if the above formula holds for all i >= 1.
A sequence is deemed eventually periodic if the formula holds only for sufficiently large i's. 
Secure pseudo-random streams seek to be a periodic sequence where the smallest N is a large value.


We usually hope that the period can also be computed via 2ᴸ-1.
The number of combinations of a state before repeating can be guessed by assuming the state's original size and the scheme of tapped bits.
Thus we can compute its total permutations minus the permutation corresponding to a state of all zeros via the formula 2ᴸ-1.

assumed tapped bits = 2
assumed state size = L
Total ammount of permutations = 2ᴸ-1




Linear Feedback Shift Registers
Consists of  a set of bits of length L that shift around per cycle according to rules set by its connection polynomial.
The amount of tapped bits is the amount of bits being operated on and these are then feed back in linear combinations to the function.
The selected bits must follow a specific order according to the length of the state.
 
[] Statistical randomness on LFSRs are very random but not effective on their own so, for a robust implementation a combination of other factors are required.


############################### [LFSR COMPOSITION] #########################################################################
[] Register = A set of memory cells that produce one bit per cell.
              The bit produced is tapped to an empty cell
 
[] FeedBack Function = A predefined set of cells are passed to the feedback function as input for the next cycle.
                       This function should ideally be non-linear.
 
[] Output = These are the single rightmost bit of each cycle.

## [CONNECTION POLYNOMIAL] ##
[ ] Properties of the output sequence are related to the properties of the binary Polynomial C(X).
[ ] Main properties of a LFSR are its Bits/Size, Feedback polynomial mapping,	Taps, Taps(hex), Period of its sequence
[ ] Connection polynomials have a special significance when the connection is primitive or irreducible.
[ ] Given a stream of output and a correct guess at the size of the register based on a KPA of some interecepted msg
we can compute its connection polynomial via the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm in order to simulates the intended receiver and construct a LFSR of minimal size.

################### Interpretation ################ 
[] The first X will denote the size/degree of the register.
[] The ammount of X's will denote how many bits are tapped within the sequence.
[] The positions of the register are from 0 to sizeof(register)-1 counting increasingly from right to left
[] the tapped bits are denoted by ..?

C(X) = X³ + X + 1
Thus
S[2] S[1] S[0]

tapped bits 
S[0] S[2]



C(X) = X³² + X³ + 1
Thus
S[31] S[30] S[29] S[28] S[27] S[26] S[25] S[24] S[23] S[22] S[21] S[20] S[19] S[18] S[17] S[16] S[15] S[14] S[13] S[12] S[11] S[10] S[9]  S[8]  S[7]  S[6]  S[5]  S[4]  S[3]  S[2]  S[1]  S[0]

tapped bits
