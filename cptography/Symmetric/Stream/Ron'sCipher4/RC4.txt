#### RC4 #### [1987]

[] Symmetric encryption
[] Also known as ARCFOUR or ARC4
[] Deployed in browsers SSL/TLS to secure traffic
[] Deployed in WEP and WPA
[] Compatible with software due to its speed and simplicity
[] Fast and compact byte oriented stream
[] Encrypts byte by byte
[] No longer used due to RC4 attacks
[] Insecure due to bias being found on output bytes,
   This occurs when the beginning of the output keystream is not discarded.
   This occurs also when nonrandom or related keys are used.

[] key stream is of equal size to plain text message
[] the key must be repeated until it matches the size of array S
[] key sizes range from 40 to 2048 bits

Encryption Stages
1. Key-scheduling algorithm (KSA)
2. Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA)
3. Encryption 

array S[256 bytes]
array key []
keystream K []

ENCRYPTION
KSA ##
The KSA part of the encryption is lways the first step regrdless if its used for enc. or dec.
Initialize S from 0 to 255
S will end up as a randomized array



PRGA##
index i loops until S[255] and loops back to S[0]
index j hops around
