[] Stream Cipher []
This cipher takes a stream of bits and encrypts them individually (bit-by-bit).
The cipher is obtained from the plaintext by combining it with a stream of keys.
Loosely based on the One-Time Pad cipher's concept of perfect security

> symmetric encryption
> low computing complexity requirements
> hardware centric
> faster than block ciphers
> used in GSM when encrypting rings into a relay
> combining operation is usually XOR





### Formula ###
Formula Index :
i = increasing variable (i++)
Y1, Y2, Y3, ... = bits
X1, X2, X3 ... = plaintext letters a,b,c, ...
S1, S2, S3 ... = crypto key
e(...)         = Encrypts on ...
d(...)         = Decrypts on ...

> Stream Encryption Operation <
[ Yi = e(Xi) = Xi + Si mod2 ] 

> Stream Decryption Operation <
[ Xi = d(Yi) = Yi + Si mod2 ]

// Why is decryption formula using addition ?
Mod2 addition and subtraction are the same.
Mod2 addition is the same as XOR operation

.Example of removing 2Si
Yi + Si mod2 
= (Yi + Si) +Si mod2  
= Yi + 2Si mod2 
= Yi Mod2 

.Mod2 | XOR  Truth table 
Xi   +   Si  =   Yi
0        0        0
0        1        1
1        0        1
1        1        0
This table proves that encryption rate of bits are 50% variable 
since a plain text zero has 50% of chance of being 1 or 0 when the key is applied. 




Where do we get the key (Si) ?
