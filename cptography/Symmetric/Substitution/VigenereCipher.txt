 Vigenere Cipher [1533]
 Must hide underlying statistics of the language for security.
 Based of the polyalphabetic version of the shift cipher

>> CRYPTOGRAPHY
[] symmetric cipher
[] not computationally secure
[] polyalphabetic substitution scheme
[] variation of substituion cipher
[] key is a word of specific length
[] key is repeated throughout the length of the message
[] sec.key + sec.msg = pub.cipherText
[] alphabet is mapped [ 0 - 25 ]
[] cipher is the sum of the msg character's alphabetic position 
   plus the key character's alphabetic poisition minus 26, as denoted in the formula bellow
 
enc/dec formula
e = ( m[i] + k[i] )mod(26)
d = ( m[i] - k[i] )mod(26)

>> CRYPTOANALYSIS
 
Method 1. Frequency analysis



Method 2. Histogram
Employed against shift and vigenere ciphers, the histogram technique implies
a bar chart comparison of the character frequency between the cipher and the underlying language
usually computed per Nᵗʰ position after the kasiski test.





Method 3. Kasiski Test
kasiski test applies to the vignere cipher method of encryption, as follows:

If a string of characters appears repeatedly in a polyalphabetic cipher
It is possible that the distance between the reocorring characters isa multiple of the lenght of the key word.
 
It is usually easier to start with reoccurring Trigrams.
 
To work out the distance we start from the last letter of the section 
until the same letter from the first repetition of said trigram of letters.
This process is repeated for other repeating trigrams.
Keep count of the number of occurences and the distance of each.
 
Assuming that the most reocurring distance value is 18
The key word must be of a length that is a factor of 18 ( 2, 3, 6, 9 )
Eve assumes that the key word is of length 6 and so prepares a table of decryption ...
