[] Substitution Cipher []
Operates on latters and its aimed at replacing every letter by a fixed ciphertext letter,
Thus it functions by mapping the alphabet text to a random permutation of characters.
Not a computationally secure system.

 CRYPTOGRAPHY

### Mono-alphabetic version
only one alphabet is used as a cipher and thus each plain text
corresponds to the same cipher character throughout the message.
key space is the cipher's range of characters
 
plainText
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
GOYDSIPELUAVCRJWXZNHBQFTMK
cipherKey
 

plainText Message = Hello  [priv]
cipherText Message = ESVVJ [pub]
key space = 26! 
          = 2⁸⁸

POV : How does m map to each cipherKey per character ?


### Polyalphabetic version
a number of alphabets were used for encryption in order to avoid repeated ciphers.
renders naive frequency analysis inaffective against it.


plainText [priv]
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
TMKGOYDSIPELUAVCRJWXZNHBQF
DCBAHGFEMLKJIZYXWVUTSRQPON
cipher 1 [pub]
cipher 2 [pub]


message[i] 
if i == odd then msg[i] = cipher1
if i == even then msg[i] = cipher2

plainText Message  = HELLO
cipherText Message = SHLJV

key space = (!26)² 
          =  162644002617632464507038883409628607021056000000000000 ≈ 2^176.76391  ≈ 2 ¹⁷⁷

POV : How many cipherKeys are being used on top of m ?
