 Vigenere Cipher [1533]
 Must hide underlying statistics of the language for security.
 Based of the polyalphabetic version of the shift cipher

>> CRYPTOGRAPHY
[] symmetric cipher
[] not computationally secure
[] polyalphabetic substitution scheme
[] variation of substituion cipher
[] key is a word of specific length
[] key is repeated throughout the length of the message
[] sec.key + sec.msg = pub.cipherText
[] alphabet is mapped [ 0 - 25 ]
[] cipher is the sum of the msg character's alphabetic position 
   plus the key character's alphabetic poisition minus 26, as denoted in the formula bellow
 
enc/dec formula
e = ( m[i] + k[i] )mod(26)
d = ( m[i] - k[i] )mod(26)

>> CRYPTOANALYSIS <<
 
Method 1. Frequency analysis



Method 2. Histogram
Employed against shift and vigenere ciphers, the histogram technique implies
a bar chart comparison of the character frequency between the cipher and the underlying language
usually computed per Nᵗʰ position after the kasiski test.





Method 3. Kasiski Test
kasiski test applies to the vignere cipher method of encryption, as follows:

1. [Identify repetitions]
If a string of characters appears repeatedly in a polyalphabetic cipher
It is possible that the distance between the reocorring characters is a multiple of the lenght of the key word.
 
It is usually easier to start with reoccurring Trigrams.
If there are no trigrams then bigrams are the following option.

2. [Identify the gaps between repetitions]
To work out the distance we start from the last letter of the section 
until the same letter from the first repetition of said trigram of letters.

This process is repeated for other repeating trigrams until the most reocurring distance is found.
Keep count of the number of occurences and the distance of each.


3. [Identify key length based on gaps]
Assuming that the most reocurring distance value is 18 there are two methods to work out the possible key length

A. The key word must be of a length that is a factor of 18 ( 2, 3, 6, 9 )

B. The key word must be of a length that by calculating the gcd() between all
pairs of gaps between repeating ciphertext, recursively in the search for a reoccurring distance produced by the gcd of two distances.


4. [Decryption table]
Eve assumes that the key word is of length 6 and so prepares a table of decryption 
by considering the range of different cipher characters as N,
the statistical distance between the underlying language and every Nᵗʰ ciphertext over an increasing key that is smaller than N
can be computed in order to determine the smallest distance.
key length = 6
1.StatDist (c[0], c[5], c[10], ...)
table of outputs from key 0 to 26 [1]

2.StatDist (c[1], c[6], c[11], ...)
table of outputs from key 0 to 26 [2]

3.StatDist (c[2], c[7], c[12], ...)
table of outputs from key 0 to 26 [3]
...
