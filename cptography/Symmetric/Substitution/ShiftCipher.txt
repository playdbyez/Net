[] Shift Cipher []

This cipher functions by shifting each character to 
an equivalent cipher value to the right of its initial value
The Caesar cipher is a shift cipher but its key is of value 3

[] the max number of characters is the 26 letter alphabet [0 - 25]
[] not computationally secure

CRYPTOANALYSIS 
 
[] Assuming all characters have the same key cipher
[] Assuming that the cipher is monoalphabetic


## Method 1.
Try each key value within the cipher's key length until the most likely result is produced



## Method 2.
Comparing letter frequencies per char vs the underlying language's general letter frequency
in order to find the most consistent value of shifts.
 
 



## Method 3.
Statistical Distance's 
Compare the cipher vs general letter distribution 
through the total variation distance formula that requires two variables for iterating through our two sets, in order 
to find the smallest distance possible, and said distance will indicate the most likely value of shifts

D1 = Set english
D2 = Set cipher
K  = Increasing key to sizeof(x) [0-25]
X  = Probabilities of english
Y  = Probability of  cipher
V  = Distance between X and Y

TOTAL VARIATION DISTANCE FORMULA:
△[X, Y] =   1/2 Σ (u∈V) | ᴾᴿx<-D1 [ X = u] - ᴾᴿY<-D2 |
