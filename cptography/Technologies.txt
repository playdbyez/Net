[ PKI ] Public Key Infrastructure
Resposible for managing X509 digital certificates and the binding public-key encryption.
Relies on the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP), Certificates Authorities (CA) and Public Key Cryptography
Present in:
email - OpenPGP/OpenMIME
documents - XML encryption
authentication - smart cards and HTTPS
communication protocols -  Internet key exchange (IKE) and SSL/TLS

- Summary -
A hash function maps a piece of data into a set-length with two specific properties, which 
together constitute a document or email's hash fingerprint:
- One Way encryption
- Hard-to-replicate output
Taking these two core aspects of encryption, it is generally applied in two forms:

> Symmetric encryption relates to using sharing the same key for encryption and decryption while 
--Stream Ciphers
--Block Ciphers

> Asymmetric encryption entails the use of a public and private keys for combined decryption and repudiation capabilities 
of said message's digital signature.


These fingerprints / signatures are then used for integrity checks against trusted databases 
that are provided by a Certificate Authority (CA).
- CAs act as a trusted third party that provide the means of checking if the public key's validity,
this is done by tieing an entity's well known credibility to said public key.
