    Sets are generally used in a relational database, a set is an unordered collection of unique values
    Sets usually come in pairs


[Types of sets]

 ℕ  = a set of natural numbers            ( 0 to 9)
 ℤ  = a set of integers                   (-9 to 9)
 Q  = a set of quotient numbers           ( (1.5 ≡ 3/2) = (Q ≡ p/q) )

( #S ) == sizeof(S)
( ℤₙ ) == ℤ/ℤN
( #ℤₙ) == N
( ℤ⁺ ) == Set of only positive ints  (0 to infinity)
( ℤ⁻ ) == Set of only negative ints  (0 to infinity)
( ℤ* ) == Set of ints with no zero included



[Symbols]

( ∈ ) == element ... is whithin set ...
I.e.  x∈Z == element x is within a set of integers

( Ø ) ==  Empty set

( ∀ ) ==	For all ...
I.e.  ∀x>1  ==	for all x is greater than 1

( ≡ ) == ... is equivalent to ...  
I.e.  13≡4(mod 9) == 13 is equivalent to 4 (%9)

( Σ ) == sum from val bellow SIGMA to val above SIGMA 

( ∝ ) == ... is proportional to ...

( ω ) ==  smallest infinite ordinal number

...etc

############ Groups #########

[] Group G is a set under the dot operation  {G,•}

[] A 'group' is a set with an operation on its elements which:
	> is closed
	> has an identity
	> Every element has an inverse

[] The set must also satisfy the C A I N properties to be a group.

C - Closure
if the result of any two elements under the group operation is within the group itself.
[ a,b ∈ G then (a + b) ∈ G ]
 
 
A - Associative
if the result of any three elements in different orders while under the group operation is within the group itself.
[ a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c) for all a,b,c ∈ G ]
 
 
I - Identity element
if the result of two elements within the group is equal to the same element used for the operation then e is the identity 
[ (a + e) = (e + a) = a for all a,e ∈ G  ]
[] e is usually zero
[] Groups of the kind bellow, under addition have the identity 0
	> integers (ℤ, +)
	> reals    (ℝ, +)
	> complex  (ℂ, +)
 
N - Inverse element
after considering the Identity element e.
the inverse of a is some other element also within the group which combined with a under the group operation will equal the identity e.
left inverse is when the inverse element is to the left of a element while performing the operation   [a' + a = e]
right inverse is when the inverse element is to the right of a element while performing the operation [a + a' = e]
[(a + a') = (a'+ a) = e for all a,a' ∈ G ]
 
 

Commutative
[ (a + b) = (b + a) for all a,b  ∈ G]
[] Any set that is a group which is commutative can be called  an 'abelian group'




#############################[Calculations]##########################################

[ ∩  == Intersection / Inner Join]
[] To calculate an Intersection in set theory values must be present in both tables A and B

A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
A∩B = {2, 4, 6}



[ ∪  == Union / Full Outter Join]
[] To calculate an Union in set theory, both tables A and B are displayed as one

A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
A∪B = {NULL, 2, NULL, 4, NULL, 6, NULL, 8, NULL 10}






etc..
