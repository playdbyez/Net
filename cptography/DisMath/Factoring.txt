############ Factoring ################

Factoring is the process of finding factors to said value.
Based off a single known value.
Un-multiplying
Essential when analysing publick key systems.
Each method of factoring varies in efficiency depending on the size of the input.

Well-knonw techniques:

DARK AGE METHODS
> Trial Division
> Pollard's p - 1 Method
> William's p + 1 Method
> Pollard rho Method


MODERN METHODS
> Continued Fraction Method (CFRAC)
> Quadratic Sieve (QS)
> Eliptic Curve Method (ECM)
> Number Field Sieve (NFS)





## Trial Division
Try every prime number up to √N to see if it is a factor of N
 [] exponent time algorithm
 [] dark age method of factoring
 [] best method for numbers less than 10¹² = 1000000000000


int e  = 0;
for ( i = 2; i < √N; i++)
{
if (N mod(i) == 0)
  {
    while (N mod(i) == 0)
      {
      e++;
      N =  N/i;
      }
  printf("factors %d and %d", i, e);
  }
}


 [] time complexity is exponential O(√N) = O(2^log2N/2) = Ln (1,1)
 [] Only works on values that do not have a perfect square number
 [] A pefect square is when both factors to N are the same number and hence, said squaring factor is equal to N
    a² = N
[] factoring is of coprime factors, int i should be only output if it is prime.
