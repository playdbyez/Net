publick key and private key
 
sign with private key and verify that signature with the public key
pub.Key is published  on the web or on a certificate
 
pubKey (e,n)
e = 65537
n = 2000 - 4000bits long value
 
privKey (d)
 
φ = phi
euler-totient = φ (p-1 * q -1)
 
if you have d then you can injuct as the shop and sell items on their behalf
dont chose bad p and q meaning:
- dont have closely related coprimes (exploitable by fermat's factorization algorithm)
- dont have small coprimes
- have it be a variation of 1024bits length each
 
 
Lots of thought goes into generating random primes!
