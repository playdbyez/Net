  [] Naive RSA Encryption

[] world's first publc key encryption algorithm
[] asymmetric encryption scheme
[] based of factoring for large primes
[] can be bypassed without factoring
[] 1024 bits 

[] p, q, d = priv
[] N, e    = pub
[] exponent e is related to totient of N via gratest common divisor as 1
[] e is the public key used with N to encrypt the message m
[] d is the private key used with N to decrypt the message m
[] m must have a decimal value smaller than N
[] N size of 2048 is medium security
[] d should be of size 1/3 x N^ยน/โด to prevent Weiner's Attack


COMMUNICATION MODEL
