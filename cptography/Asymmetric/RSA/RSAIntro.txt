  [] Naive RSA Encryption []

[] world's first publc key encryption algorithm
[] asymmetric encryption scheme
[] based of factoring for large primes
[] can be bypassed without factoring
[] key size 1024 to 4096 bits 


[] p, q, d = priv
[] N, e    = pub
[] exponent e is related to totient of N via gratest common divisor as 1
[] NIST does not allow value e to be lower than 65537
[] e is the public key used with N to encrypt the message m
[] d is the private key used with N to decrypt the message m
[] m must have a decimal value smaller than N
[] N size of 2048 is medium security
[] d should be of size 1/3 x N^ยน/โด to prevent Weiner's Attack
[] p and q should not be values to close to each other to prevent Fermat factorization

COMMUNICATION MODEL

N = 77
e = 37
d = 13
m = 2
c = 51


>BOB 
(encrypts)
m = 2
c = 2^37 mod (77)
c = 51

{-BOB TRANSMITS c TO ALICE-}

>ALICE
(decrypts)
c = 51
m = 51^13
m = 2
