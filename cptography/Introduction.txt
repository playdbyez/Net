Cryptography 2010
by Christof Paar


//Kerckhuff's Principle [ 1883 ]
"A crypto system should be secure even if an attacker knows of the details about the system,
with the exception of the secret key"
This passage remarks that a sharing keys requires lots of nuance and creative methods.
There is no mathematical proof that any cryptographic algorithm is 100% secure.
Only the duration of how many years a given crypto-algorithm has remained unbroken can be ascertained.
Algorithms should be released public but not the key.

Expect a cryptosystem to be eventually broken, either through computing 
improvements or an algorithmic breakthrough.

Unconditionally secure systems cannot be broken even with infinite computing power.



-        Cryptology          -
Although Security is a bigger concept that encompasses cryptology,
Security cannot be achieved only by cryptology 
but with standardized algorithms, cipher-text, encrypt/decrypt keys

<> Cryptography
Building a secure algorithm.
Complexity theory + Information theory

> Symmetric Algorithms
> Asymmetric Algorithms
> Protocols
> Keyspace

<> Cryptanalysis
Deconstructing a secure algorithm.
> Classical == Looking at the cipher as a blackbox, we an only infer and observe input and output with the help of a bruteforce vector, for example.
> Analytical == Inspecting the cipher's schematic, for example, letter frequencies are maintained


<> Weaknessess
> BruteForce
> Exhaustive KeySearch

############::Cryptographic Protocols::############## 

[1] Mutually trusting parties
These types of protocols infer that both parties have the same security goals,
they also assume that an adversary is external to the protocol.
- Encryption
- Hash functions
- MACs
- Digital Signatures

[2] Mutually untrusting parties
These assume that the parties involved have conflicting/different security goals
The adversaies are parties within  the protocol.
- Commitment Schemes
- Oblivious Transfer

Keysearch on an FPGA based,cryptanalitical algorithm 'Copacobana' key searches can take up to 1 week
Copacabana's max keysearch = 2^56








########################### :: Randomness :: #########################################


//When implementing any sort of encryption along a channel 
            its necessary to first determine randomness of the cypher key between both end-points

> True random number generator (TRNG)
True random numbers stem from random physical processes.
