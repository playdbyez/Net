Cryptography 2010
by Christof Paar


//Kerckhuff's Principle [ 1883 ]
"A crypto system should be secure even if an attacker knows of the details about the system,
with the exception of the secret key"
This passage remarks that a sharing keys requires lots of nuance and creative methods.
There is no mathematical proof that any cryptographic algorithm is 100% secure.
Only the duration of how many years a given crypto-algorithm has remained unbroken can be ascertained.
Algorithms should be released public but not the key.

-        Cryptology          -
Although Security is a bigger concept that encompasses cryptology,
Security cannot be achieved only by cryptology 
but with standardized algorithms, cipher-text, encrypt/decrypt keys

############::KeySearch::############## 
Within symmetric ciphers we consider its size in bits.
and apply the FPGA based,cryptanalitical algorithm 'Copacobana'  (1 week)

I.E.
cipher key size = 64b its
solution = 2^64 bits
roughly = 2^88

If the key manages a lookup table, we compare its character to 
its possibility of being said character from the alphabet (26 letters) granting us a 26! factorial.
cipher[0] = 1 out of 26 letters of the alphabet
cipher[1] = 1 out of 25 letters of the alphabet
cipher[2] = 1 out of 24 letters of the alphabet ...
Copacabana's max keysearch = 2^56


############::Letter Frequency Analysis ::##############

//Substitution Cipher
Operates on latters and its aimed at replacing every letter by a fixed ciphertext letter.

//0Bruteforce
E > T > A > I > O > N > S > H > R > D > L > U > C > M > F > Y > W > G > P > B > V > K > X > Q > J > Z

>Letters have different frequencies in english
>The frequency of plaintext letters  is preserved  in ciphertext
>Almost 13% of all letters in a string is the letter 'E' ==  every 7th or 8th letter is an E
>About 9% of all letters in a string is the letter 'T'

############::Implementation Attacks ::##############
A Side channel attack would consist of employing an osciloscope against a microprocessor's pins
and recording the ondulation  or observe  the timing behaviour in hope to decode the key being used within the chip.




########################### :: Randomness :: #########################################


//When implementing any sort of encryption along a channel 
            its necessary to first determine randomness of the cypher key between both end-points

<>Random Number Generator

> True random number generator (TRNG)
True random numbers stem from random physical processes.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: :: Modular Arithmetic :: ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

IDEA: computation in finite sets based in arithmetic rules
kind of like arranging a formula into a 'circle' 


I.E : "Now is 12AM andwe will meet in 20 hrs" 
resulting in an absolute value of "we will meet at hours 32"
resulting in an algebraic value based on modulus-24 value of "we will meet at 8AM the next day"


############::Modulo operator (%)::##############
Definition :
[ Find the value of R ]
if
            int A, R ,M ∈Z
            m > 0

Then
            A ≡ R (mod M)
            meaning M devides A - R 
            [ M|(A-R) ]
            R = Remainder of modulus
            M = Modulus
            Solution = solve A-R and relate it to M after

//Exercise 1:
A = 13
M = 9
R = ?
13 = ? x 9

How often does the modulus 9 fit into A? (quotient)
Result is once = 1
                        13-9 = 4
Remainder is  4
Solution is             13 ≡ 4 (mod 9)




//Answer Check:
13-4 = 9
(A - R = ?)

is the solution divisible by the remainder ?
Yes 9 is divisible by 9

/The value of R/remainder can fluctuate since it is not unique 
/The above mentioned is dependent on what value is given to R as a divisor used on A 
/Always perform the Answer Check after the calculation


>>Equivalence Classes:
                        [ All members of the class behave equivalent modulo 9 ]


Given mod 9, define its set :
include all natural numbers forming an 'equivalence class' modulo 9
    (+9   +9  +9   +9  +9  +9)

... -19   -9   0   9   20  27 ... SET A
... -18   -8   1   10  19  28 ... SET B
... -17   -7   2   11  20  29 ... SET C
... -16   -6   3   12  21  30 ... SET D
... -14   -5   4   13  22  31 ... SET E
... -13   -4   5   14  23  32 ... SET F
... -12   -3   6   15  24  33 ... SET G
... -11   -2   7   16  25  34 ... SET H
... -10   -1   8   17  26  35 ... SET I
//Every set is infinite in size with the remainder of modulus as the centre value

::::::::::::::::::

//Exercise 2:
A = 13
M = 9
R = ?
13 = ? x 9
