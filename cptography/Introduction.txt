//Kerckhuff's Principle [ 1883 ]
"A crypto system should be secure even if an attacker knows of the details about the system,
with the exception of the secret key"
This passage remarks that a sharing keys requires lots of nuance and creative methods.
There is no mathematical proof that any cryptographic algorithm is 100% secure.
Only the duration of how many years a given crypto-algorithm has remained unbroken can be ascertained.
Algorithms should be released public but not the key.

-        Cryptology          -
Although Security is a bigger concept that encompasses cryptology,
Security cannot be achieved only by cryptology 
but with standardized algorithms, cipher-text, encrypt/decrypt keys

<> Cryptanalysis
Deconstructing a secure algorithm.
> Classical == Looking at the cipher as a blakbox, we an only infer and observe input and output with the help of a bruteforce vector, for example.
> Analytical == Inspecting the cipher's schematic, for example, letter frequencies are maintained

//Substitution Cipher
Operates on latters and its aimed at replacing every letter by a fixed ciphertext letter.

############::KeySearch::############## 
Within symmetric ciphers we consider its size in bits.
and apply the FPGA based,cryptanalitical algorithm 'Copacobana'  (1 week)


I.E.
cipher key size = 64b its
solution = 2^64 bits
roughly = 2^88

If the key manages a lookup table, we compare its character to 
its possibility of being said character from the alphabet (26 letters) granting us a 26! factorial.
cipher[0] = 1 out of 26 letters of the alphabet
cipher[1] = 1 out of 25 letters of the alphabet
cipher[2] = 1 out of 24 letters of the alphabet ...
Copacabana's max keysearch = 2^56


############::Letter Frequency Analysis ::##############
Bruteforce
E > T > A > I > O > N > S > H > R > D > L > U > C > M > F > Y > W > G > P > B > V > K > X > Q > J > Z

>Letters have different frequencies in english
>The frequency of plaintext letters  is preserved  in ciphertext
>Almost 13% of all letters in a string is the letter 'E' ==  every 7th or 8th letter is an E
>About 9% of all letters in a string is the letter 'T'

############::Implementation Attacks ::##############
A Side channel attack would consist of employing an osciloscope against a microprocessor's pins
and recording the ondulation  or observe  the timing behaviour in hope to decode the key being used within the chip.
