Cryptography 2010

//Kerckhuff's Principle [ 1883 ]
"A crypto system should be secure even if an attacker knows of the details about the system,
with the exception of the secret key"
This passage remarks that a sharing keys requires lots of nuance and creative methods.
There is no mathematical proof that any cryptographic algorithm is 100% secure.
Only the duration of how many years a given crypto-algorithm has remained unbroken can be ascertained.
Algorithms should be released public but not the key.

Although Security is a bigger concept that encompasses cryptology,
Security cannot be achieved only by cryptology 
but with standardized algorithms, cipher-text, encrypt/decrypt keys

//Substitution Cipher
Operates on latters and its aimed at replacing every letter by a fixed ciphertext letter.

//KeySearch 
Within symmetric ciphers we consider its size in bits.
and apply the FPGA based,cryptanalitical algorithm 'Copacobana'  (1 week)


I.E.
cipher key size = 64b its
solution = 2^64 bits

If the key manages a lookup table, we compare its character to 
its possibility of being said character from the alphabet (26 letters) granting us a 26 factorial.
cipher[0] = 1 out of 26 letters of the alphabet
cipher[1] = 1 out of 25 letters of the alphabet
cipher[2] = 1 out of 24 letters of the alphabet ...
