Since Information Theory is fundamental to computer science, it is essential to distinguish between
information-theoretic security and computational security

A cryptographic system is deemed computationally secure if the best known algorithm for breaking it requires
more than an unfeasable ammount of operations (2¹²⁸), although it can still be broken if there is a better unknown algorithm.
These systems also require being provably secure.

A cryptographic system is deemed unconditionally secure if it cannot be broken even with infinite computing power.

  [] Entropy ###################
Entropy measures the ammount of uncertainty in a random variable.
Thus H(X) will calculate the ammount of information a variable X can reveal based on the certainty of its behaviour
against  a condition with finite outcome n.
[] H(X) >= 0 always


FORMULA
H(X) = - ᵢ₌₁Σⁿ pi x log2(pi)

CASE 1
If you know my answer every time then it contains no information and certainly its entropy H(X) = 0
p1 = 1
p2 = 0
H(X) = (-1 x log2(1) ) (-0 x log2(0) ) = 0


CASE 2
If you dont know my answer and I have equal probability of choosing between two options
then my answer contains one bit of information and its entropy H(X) = 1
p1 = 1/2
p2 = p1
H(X) = (- log2(1/2) / 2 ) (- log(1/2) / 2) = 1 

CASE 3
if the number of choices is 26 and my answers are unknown with equal probability of choice per option 
and said option can also be repeated,then the entropy per choice is H(X)  = log2(n)
pi = 1/n for all i
H(X) = log2(26) = 4.70


[] Joint entropy





  [] Perfect Secrecy ######################################
A system in which the public cipher gives no information about the message.
Knowing the cipher equivalent reveals no information.

if the probability that one character from the encrypted message is equal to M when we know the cipher is equal to C,
is the same as the probability that the character is M withouth knowing that the cipher is C.
The cipher has perfect secrecy.

FORMULA
p( C = c | P = m ) = p (C = c)
// the probability of c being a certain cipher and the probability of a message character being a certain letter
// is equal to the probability that the cipher is a certain cipher


> Shannon's Theorem <
Defines a perfectly secure system if
  - The key is unique per message
  - The ammount of keys is equal to the length of the message
  - every key is used with equal probability 1 /#K

#K = set of key characters      (k)
#P = set of message characters  (m)
#C = set of cipher characters   (c)

Since each key is used with equal probability, we must define the probability of each cipher p(C = c).

p( C = c ) = Σₖ p(K = k) x p(P = dₖ(c))
           = 1 / #K Σₖ  p(P = dₖ(c))

Since each message character uses an unique key

Σₖ p(P = dₖ(c)) = Σₚ p (P = m) = 1

hence  p(C = c) = 1/#K

Since c = eₖ(m) then  p (C = C | P = m) = p(K = k) = 1/#K

Through Baes' Theorem

p(P = m | C = c) = p(P = m) x p (C = c | P = m) / p(C = c)
                 = (p(P = m) x 1/#K) / (1/#K)
                 = p(P = m)
